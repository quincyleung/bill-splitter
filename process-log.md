# Process log

## Step 1: Project context (2026-10-18)

**Asked:** Project context only, no app code. Move anything useful from CLAUDE.md into AGENTS.md and delete CLAUDE.md. Write a short AGENTS.md covering who it's for, constraints, rules and workflow. Then stop.

**Made:**
- There was no CLAUDE.md, so there was nothing to move or delete.
- Added four sections to AGENTS.md: who it's for, constraints, rules and workflow. Kept the Next.js block at the top, because `next dev` writes it back if it's removed.
- Started this log.

**Pushed back:** Nothing yet.

## Step 2: Design the flows (2026-10-18)

**Asked:** Design the flows before any code. Three kinds of bill: group meals split by who ordered what, with tax and tip shared proportionally (the part I care most about); Uber rides split evenly; and monthly bills with roommates. Work out three flows: the first visit with nothing saved, the main task (add a bill → choose who and how to split → see who owes me → mark paid), and coming back next week or next month. For each, propose screens, routes, states (empty, partly filled, error, success) and errors. Flag what to cut. No code; I choose what to keep.

**Made:**
- A proposal (in plan mode) with routes, phone-sized wireframes, a state table for each flow, exact error wording, non-blocking warnings, a list of cuts and nine decisions, each with a recommendation.
- Things I raised that weren't in the brief: one "Total paid" field instead of separate tax and tip fields; leftover pennies go to me so friends are never overcharged; a loading state so returning users don't see a flash of the empty screen; an autosaved draft; "Copy amounts" so friends find out what they owe; a person page with "Mark all paid"; and the risk that iPhone Safari deletes saved data after 7 days without a visit.
- `flows.md`: the agreed version, which later steps build against.

**Kept:** All nine recommendations, approved as proposed. Currency is still open and needs choosing before the first form.

**Pushed back:** Nothing. The proposal was approved as is.

## Step 2, continued: Changes to the flows (2026-10-18)

**Asked:**
- Three modes: meal, even split (one time) and recurring.
- Let me owe people too, e.g. when my roommate pays the utilities.
- An easier way to enter meal items than typing, such as a photo of the receipt.
- For recurring, let me pick how often: weekly, every 2 weeks, monthly or custom.
- Use $ as the currency, with an option to switch.

**Made:**
- Rules for owing people: every bill has one payer (me or anyone on the bill), only debts between me and the payer are tracked, Home shows a net balance per person, and the person page has Settle up.
- Three ways to read receipts, compared: paste text copied with the phone's built-in text recognition (no package or API), an OCR package in the app, or an AI API. Recommended pasting.
- Tested the paste idea with a scratch script on a real receipt pasted from the phone. All 5 items and the $258.93 subtotal came out right. The test also changed the design: find items by their prices because the paste had no line breaks, read leading quantities, stop at Subtotal so suggested-tip lines aren't read as dishes, and offer the receipt total under Total paid without filling it in automatically.
- Recurring frequency, with next-due dates and the month-end rule.
- Currency per bill, defaulting to the last one used (first default $ USD), shown per currency with no conversion.
- Rewrote `flows.md` with all of the above.

**Pushed back:**
- I had cut "friends owing each other / more than one payer". You wanted to owe people too, so the payer can now be someone else (debts between two other people are still cut).
- I had made recurring bills monthly only. You wanted to choose the frequency.
- I had cut more than one currency. You wanted to be able to switch.
- I had items typed in only. You asked for a receipt photo, tried pasting the text from your phone (the first paste was the wrong clipboard), and chose pasting the receipt or typing the items.
